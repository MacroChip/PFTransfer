simple-peer is a stream, therefore, i cannot assume that my data will be received in the same chunks that i sent it in
options:
-2 peer connections. 1 for metadata/controls, 1 for data
-switch the stream in and out of a control vs data mode
-parse the stream live looking for control events
-use socket.io-p2p but strip out the fallback stuff
-use https://github.com/tomcartwrightuk/socket.io-p2p-parser in order to know when binary data has completed sending
